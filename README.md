# LAI Study
## Using OpenCellID to determine geofence for LAI

There are two submodules to this git repo!

So far, there are two scripts of interest:

* towers_by_lai.py: Breaks OpenCellID DB into files for each LAI, in CSV and
  KML format.  KML goes into the submodule rooted at `data/derived/kml`.
* report_outliers.py: Takes the files produced by the first script and produces
  CSV and MD reports on nearest neighbor CGI, with distances beyond 30km
  appearing in bold on MD reports.  These files go into the other submodule,
  rooted at `reports/`


In order to run these scripts, you will need API access to Twilio, because
that's where we get the information to correlate MCC+MNC with the owning
provider.  You will also need to get a copy of the OpenCellID database from
http://opencellid.org/#action=database.downloadDatabase

Place the OpenCellID database at `lai-analysis/data/source`.  It should be named
`cell_towers.csv.gz` when you download it.  Just move it into place without
decompressing or renaming it.


This is written for Python 2.7.  Required modules are in requirements.txt:

Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The towers_by_lai file is the first stage.  It places the feed in files by LAI,
ready to be processed by report_outliers.py.  

The report_outliers.py script feeds rabbitmq on localhost, and you'll need to
run `celery worker -A celeryutils` to process the jobs.  If you want a nice web
interface to watch the jobs go by, install flower (from pip) and
`celery flower -A celeryutils`.  Go to the URL that comes up after starting
and you'll be able to adjust your queues, etc...

### Profiling

Navigate to code/tests/profile and run
`python -m cProfile -o profile_data.pyprof profile_process_one_file.py`, and
then dissect it with Kcachegrind or Qcachegrind.

### Testing

Pytest is required for testing.

Navigate to `code/tests/` and run `py.test`
